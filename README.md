# WorldShaper
Game engine made from scratch using OpenGL and custom engine tools

# Core Systems 
Make singleton managers and create generalized objects:
  TextureManager - Complete
  ModelManager - Complete
  GameObjectManager - Complete
  ShaderManager - Complete

# TODO
- Fix ShaderManager to load proper shader .vert and .frag GLSL files
- Add OpenGL implementation to draw models in Model
- Add OpenGL implementation to draw texture in Texture
- Add OpenGL implementation to draw using shader in Shader
- Add logic to use core game engine to draw game object with model and texture using shader
